# EcoBenchmark:

Image recognition is a rapidly growing sector of AI, with models rapidly improving across a wide variety of tasks ([text](https://developers.googleblog.com/conversational-image-segmentation-gemini-2-5/))

It is only a matter of time before these models surpase traditional machine learning image recognitions tasks, such as ecological detection. 

# Goals 

This project aims to do the following:

- Benchmark preformance of leading LLMs for ecological detection
- Compare capabilities of LLM image recognition to a tree detection model, deepforest
- Measure the impacts of adding training data, tweaking prompts
